In this project I analyzed several Youtube channels that have helped me in my data science journey and present my findings using streamlit by building a web app.
This project uses YouTube Data API to extract the desired information about the channels and then use other libraries such as Pandas, matplotlib,seaborn for data wrangling and streamlit to build a dashboard.

To go through every step (aside from the streamlit), go and check the jupyter notebook file Youtube Channel Analysis Notebook, and to see all together, including the streamlit code, check Main.py

Note: The CSV files were saved (general.csv and videos.csv) to build a PowerBI dashboard
